## historical notes
frf was originally written in purebasic, for reasons.

i didn't really 'do' version control the first times I worked on this project so there are two archival branches, which will remain as-is for historical purposes:
*  `frf-prototype-1`
*  `frf-partial-rework`

the partial rework was undirected and very much a victim of second system syndrome, and never actually worked.

since frf-prototype-1 was functioning (if kinda simplistic), i intended to try to build off of that and make incremental changes, the results of which can be found in `frf-failed-revival`. i got it working with a newer purebasic version, but i quickly ran into some of the demoralization issues that caused me to halt before, mostly having to do with the unfortunate state of the purebasic language and its community.

in the archival branches, documentation is clearly some kind of attempt at graphing the design as of 2012, i have no idea on how accurate it is at this point.

i am dubious as to their value, so I have removed those files from master.

## temp
temp in the archival branches contains mysterious things. i cannot remember their purpose. (except the propertygrid bits, those are probably source examples that I used for `propgrid.pb`)
